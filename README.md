# Summary of Data Breaches and Supply Chain Structure

## Context
Supply chains are becoming increasingly interconnected, which improves responsiveness and enables diversification but also introduces new vulnerabilities. This study addresses whether data breaches impact a firm's supply chain structure and whether Information Technology (IT) firms are affected differently than firms in other industries. The authors argue that data breaches trigger structural responses, where firms may increase their supplier base to acquire cybersecurity capabilities, while IT firms may specifically constrain risks by reducing their number of suppliers.

## Data and Methodology
The dataset was constructed by combining four primary sources:
* **Supply Chain Relationships:** Used to build a comprehensive directional network of supplier-customer relationships, comprising 12,513 nodes and 32,373 edges after data modelling.
* **Audit Analytics Cybersecurity (AAC) & Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC):** These databases provided data on breach disclosures, compiling information from SEC filings, state documents, and verifiable media sources.
* **Compustat Fundamentals Annual:** Supplied financial data to calculate control variables such as firm size, R&D intensity, SGA intensity, and inventory-to-sales ratios.
* **WRDS Supply Chain Dataset:** Utilized to capture strategic supplier relationships based on customers that represent 10% or more of a firm's sales.

* Resulted in a dataset with **788 publicly traded firms** in the United States, covering the period from **2005 to 2019**.
